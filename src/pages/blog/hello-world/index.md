This is my first post on my new `fake blog`! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write [a lot more interesting things](/blog/hi-folks/) in the future.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'

export default class NotFoundPage extends Component {
  // This is a comment!
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>NOT FOUND</h1>
        <p>
          You just hit a route that doesn&#39;t exist. You just hit a route that
          doesn&#39;t exist.
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Here's a YouTube video:

And here's a diagram:

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
